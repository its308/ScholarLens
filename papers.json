By `mainstream' we\nmean the type of climate science that dominates in universities and research\ncentres, which we will term `academic' climate science, in contrast to `policy'\nclimate science; aspects of this distinction will become clearer in what\nfollows.\n  In a nutshell, we do not think that academic climate science equips climate\nscientists to be as helpful as they might be, when involved in climate policy\nassessment. Partly, we attribute this to an over-investment in high resolution\nclimate simulators, and partly to a culture that is uncomfortable with the\ninherently subjective nature of climate uncertainty.\n",

Many of those tasks have been addressed on datasets created with single\nclimate models. However, both the climate science and ML communities have\nsuggested that to address those tasks at scale, we need large, consistent, and\nML-ready climate model datasets. Here, we introduce ClimateSet, a dataset\ncontaining the inputs and outputs of 36 climate models from the Input4MIPs and\nCMIP6 archives. In addition, we provide a modular dataset pipeline for\nretrieving and preprocessing additional climate models and scenarios. We\nshowcase the potential of our dataset by using it as a benchmark for ML-based\nclimate model emulation. We gain new insights about the performance and\ngeneralization capabilities of the different ML models by analyzing their\nperformance across different climate models. Furthermore, the dataset can be\nused to train an ML emulator on several climate models instead of just one.\nSuch a \"super emulator\" can quickly project new climate change scenarios,\ncomplementing existing scenarios already provided to policymakers.

To better understand climate, historical\nclimate (e.g. archived meteorological variables such as temperature, wind,\nwater, etc.) and climate-related data (e.g. geographical features and human\nactivities) are widely used by today's climate research to derive models for an\nexplainable climate change and its effects. However, such data sources are\noften dispersed across a multitude of disconnected data silos on the Web.\nMoreover, there is a lack of advanced climate data platforms to enable\nmulti-source heterogeneous climate data analysis, therefore, researchers must\nface a stern challenge in collecting and analyzing multi-source data. In this\npaper, we address this problem by proposing a climate knowledge graph for the\nintegration of multiple climate data and other data sources into one service,\nleveraging Web technologies (e.g. HTTP) for multi-source climate data analysis.\nThe proposed knowledge graph is primarily composed of data from the National\nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration's daily climate summaries,\nOpenStreetMap, and Wikidata, and it supports joint data queries on these widely\nused databases. This paper shows, with a use case in Ireland and the United\nKingdom, how climate researchers could benefit from this platform as it allows\nthem to easily integrate datasets from different domains and geographical\nlocations.\n",

This paper proposes a Climate Change\nVulnerability Assessment Framework (CCVAF) to assess climate change\nvulnerabilities among rural farmers. The CCVAF framework uses information and\ncommunication technology (ICT) to assess climate change vulnerabilities among\nrural farmers by integrating both community level and individual household\nlevel indicators. The CCVAF was instantiated into a GIS-based web application\nnamed THRIVE for different decision-makers to better assess how climate change\nis affecting rural farmers in Western Honduras. Qualitative evaluation of the\nTHRIVE showed that it is an innovative and useful tool. The CCVAF contributes\nto not only the knowledge base of the climate change vulnerability assessment\nbut also the design science literature by providing guidelines to design a\nclass of climate change vulnerability assessment solutions.\n",

We evaluate the\nperformance of eight RL algorithms on two idealised environments: one for\ntemperature bias correction, another for radiative-convective equilibrium (RCE)\nimitating real-world computational constraints. Results show different RL\napproaches excel in different climate scenarios with exploration algorithms\nperforming better in bias correction, while exploitation algorithms proving\nmore effective for RCE.

In this\nstudy, we deal with the question of how research on climate change and policy\nare connected. In 2019, the new Overton database of policy documents was\nreleased including links to research papers that are cited by policy documents.\nThe use of results and recommendations from research on climate change might be\nreflected in citations of scientific papers in policy documents. Although we\nsuspect a lot of uncertainty related to the coverage of policy documents in\nOverton, there seems to be an impact of international climate policy cycles on\npolicy document publication. We observe local peaks in climate policy documents\naround major decisions in international climate diplomacy. Our results point\nout that IGOs and think tanks -- with a focus on climate change -- have\npublished more climate change policy documents than expected. We found that\nclimate change papers that are cited in climate change policy documents\nreceived significantly more citations on average than climate change papers\nthat are not cited in these documents. Both areas of society (science and\npolicy) focus on similar climate change research fields: biology, earth\nsciences, engineering, and disease sciences. Based on these and other empirical\nresults in this study, we propose a simple model of policy impact considering a\nchain of different document types: the chain starts with scientific assessment\nreports (systematic reviews) that lead via science communication documents\n(policy briefs, policy reports or plain language summaries) and government\nreports to legislative documents.\n",

By providing a dataset for the research\ncommunity, we aim to facilitate and encourage work on improving algorithms for\nretrieving evidential support for climate-specific claims, addressing the\nunderlying language understanding challenges, and ultimately help alleviate the\nimpact of misinformation on climate change. We adapt the methodology of FEVER\n[1], the largest dataset of artificially designed claims, to real-life claims\ncollected from the Internet. While during this process, we could rely on the\nexpertise of renowned climate scientists, it turned out to be no easy task. We\ndiscuss the surprising, subtle complexity of modeling real-world\nclimate-related claims within the \\textsc{fever} framework, which we believe\nprovides a valuable challenge for general natural language understanding. We\nhope that our work will mark the beginning of a new exciting long-term joint\neffort by the climate science and AI community.\n",

        "summary": "  Climate misinformation is a problem that has the potential to be\nsubstantially aggravated by the development of Large Language Models (LLMs). In\nthis study we evaluate the potential for LLMs to be part of the solution for\nmitigating online dis/misinformation rather than the problem. Employing a\npublic expert annotated dataset and a curated sample of social media content we\nevaluate the performance of proprietary vs. open source LLMs on climate\nmisinformation classification task, comparing them to existing climate-focused\ncomputer-assisted tools and expert assessments. Results show (1) open-source\nmodels substantially under-perform in classifying climate misinformation\ncompared to proprietary models, (2) existing climate-focused computer-assisted\ntools leveraging expert-annotated datasets continues to outperform many of\nproprietary models, including GPT-4o, and (3) demonstrate the efficacy and\ngeneralizability of fine-tuning GPT-3.5-turbo on expert annotated dataset in\nclassifying claims about climate change at the equivalency of climate change\nexperts with over 20 years of experience in climate communication. These\nfindings highlight 1) the importance of incorporating human-oversight, such as\nincorporating expert-annotated datasets in training LLMs, for governance tasks\nthat require subject-matter expertise like classifying climate misinformation,\nand 2) the potential for LLMs in facilitating civil society organizations to\nengage in various governance tasks such as classifying false or misleading\nclaims in domains beyond climate change such as politics and health science.\n",
