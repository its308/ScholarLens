Though many\nML applications have already been discovered and many are still under\ninvestigation, only a few have been adopted by current healthcare systems. As a\nresult, there exists an enormous opportunity in healthcare system for ML but\ndistributed information, scarcity of properly arranged and easily explainable\ndocumentation in related sector are major impede which are making ML\napplications difficult to healthcare professionals. This study aimed to gather\nML applications in different areas of healthcare concisely and more effectively\nso that necessary information can be accessed immediately with relevant\nreferences. We divided our study into five major groups: community level work,\nrisk management/ preventive care, healthcare operation management, remote care,\nand early detection. Dividing these groups into subgroups, we provided relevant\nreferences with description in tabular form for quick access. Our objective is\nto inform people about ML applicability in healthcare industry, reduce the\nknowledge gap of clinicians about the ML applications and motivate healthcare\nprofessionals towards more machine learning based healthcare system.\n",

The purpose of this study is to\nconstruct a secure health monitoring system in healthcare 5.0 by utilizing a\nblockchain technology and Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to detect any\nmalicious activity in a healthcare network and enables physicians to monitor\npatients through medical sensors and take necessary measures periodically by\npredicting diseases.\n",

        "summary": "  Recent advancements in multimodal machine learning have empowered the\ndevelopment of accurate and robust AI systems in the medical domain, especially\nwithin centralized database systems. Simultaneously, Federated Learning (FL)\nhas progressed, providing a decentralized mechanism where data need not be\nconsolidated, thereby enhancing the privacy and security of sensitive\nhealthcare data. The integration of these two concepts supports the ongoing\nprogress of multimodal learning in healthcare while ensuring the security and\nprivacy of patient records within local data-holding agencies. This paper\noffers a concise overview of the significance of FL in healthcare and outlines\nthe current state-of-the-art approaches to Multimodal Federated Learning (MMFL)\nwithin the healthcare domain. It comprehensively examines the existing\nchallenges in the field, shedding light on the limitations of present models.\nFinally, the paper outlines potential directions for future advancements in the\nfield, aiming to bridge the gap between cutting-edge AI technology and the\nimperative need for patient data privacy in healthcare applications.\n",

However, successful adoption of AI-based systems in\nhealthcare depends on engaging and educating stakeholders from diverse\nbackgrounds about the development process of AI models. We present a broadly\naccessible overview of the development life cycle of clinical AI models that is\ngeneral enough to be adapted to most machine learning projects, and then give\nan in-depth case study of the development process of a deep learning based\nsystem to detect aortic aneurysms in Computed Tomography (CT) exams. We hope\nother healthcare institutions and clinical practitioners find the insights we\nshare about the development process useful in informing their own model\ndevelopment efforts and to increase the likelihood of successful deployment and\nintegration of AI in healthcare.\n",
